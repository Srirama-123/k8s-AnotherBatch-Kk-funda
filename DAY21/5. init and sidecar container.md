# Kubernetes Init Containers & Sidecar Containers - Complete Working Examples & Explanation

---

## 1. Init Containers Example (Pre-Start Tasks)

Purpose:  
Init containers run before the main app container starts. They are useful for:
- Waiting for services
- Setting up configs
- Pre-start checks

---

### YAML: Init Container Example

apiVersion: v1  
kind: Pod  
metadata:  
  name: init-container-demo  
  namespace: test-ns  
spec:  
  containers:  
  - name: main-app  
    image: busybox  
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo Main App Running; sleep 3600']  
  initContainers:  
  - name: init-wait  
    image: busybox  
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo Init Task Starting; sleep 10; echo Init Task Done']

---

### Commands to Apply & Check Logs:

kubectl apply -f init-container.yaml  
kubectl get pods -n test-ns -w  

Check Init Container Logs:  
kubectl logs init-container-demo -n test-ns -c init-wait  

Check Main App Logs:  
kubectl logs init-container-demo -n test-ns -c main-app  

---

### Explanation:
- Init container runs first, waits for 10 seconds, prints logs, then exits.
- Only after it finishes, the main app starts.

---

## 2. Sidecar Containers Example (Run Together)

Purpose:  
Sidecar containers run together with the main app and are useful for:
- Logging agents
- Proxies
- Monitoring tools

---

### YAML: Sidecar Container Example (Log Writer + Log Watcher)

apiVersion: v1  
kind: Pod  
metadata:  
  name: sidecar-container-demo  
  namespace: test-ns  
spec:  
  volumes:  
  - name: shared-logs  
    emptyDir: {}  

  containers:  
  - name: main-app  
    image: busybox  
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do echo $(date) Writing Logs >> /logs/app.log; sleep 5; done']  
    volumeMounts:  
    - name: shared-logs  
      mountPath: /logs  

  - name: sidecar-log-watcher  
    image: busybox  
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'tail -f /logs/app.log']  
    volumeMounts:  
    - name: shared-logs  
      mountPath: /logs  

---

### Commands to Apply & Check Logs:

kubectl apply -f sidecar-container.yaml  
kubectl get pods -n test-ns -w  

Check Sidecar Container Logs (Tail Logs):  
kubectl logs sidecar-container-demo -n test-ns -c sidecar-log-watcher  

Check Main App Container Logs:  
kubectl logs sidecar-container-demo -n test-ns -c main-app  

You may not see logs in main-app because it writes logs to a file, not stdout.

To Check Logs Inside Container (Verify File Logs):  
kubectl exec -it sidecar-container-demo -n test-ns -c main-app -- sh  
cat /logs/app.log  

---

### Explanation:
- Both containers share /logs volume.
- Main app writes logs to file continuously.
- Sidecar container tails and prints those logs live.

## Key Differences Between Init & Sidecar Containers

| Feature             | Init Container                        | Sidecar Container                   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| When Runs           | Before main container starts           | Together with main container        |
| Purpose             | Setup tasks (DB migration, pre-checks) | Helper tasks (logging, monitoring)  |
| Runs Together?      | No                                     | Yes                                 |
| Logs Check Method   | Logs disappear after completion        | Logs always available while running |
| Real-world Examples | DB schema setup, wait for DB           | Logging agents, service proxies     |

## Common Trainer Tips:
- Init Containers always run first and must finish successfully.
- Sidecar Containers run side by side with main app for additional functionality.
- Both concepts are common in Microservice & DevOps deployments.

---

## Useful Commands Cheat Sheet:

kubectl get pods -n test-ns -w  

kubectl logs <pod-name> -n test-ns -c <container-name>  

kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n test-ns -c <container-name> -- sh  

---

### How To Explain in Interviews:
- Init containers are like pre-flight checks before app launches.
- Sidecar containers are like helpers that work alongside main apps.
- Both enhance modularity and reusability of Kubernetes apps.
