Here are some **Kubernetes Architecture** based **scenario-based interview questions with explanations**, ideal for real-world DevOps interviews and student training:


### ✅ **1. Scenario: Control Plane Failure**

**Question:**
If the Kubernetes control plane node goes down, what happens to the running applications? How do you recover from this?

**Answer:**
**Scenario:** Your application pods are running fine, but suddenly the master/control plane node becomes unreachable.

**Concept:**
Kubernetes architecture has a **Control Plane** (API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, etcd) and **Worker Nodes** (Kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime).

**What happens:**

* Application pods **keep running** on worker nodes.
* But **no new deployments**, **auto-scaling**, or **node failure detection** will work.
* Cluster is in a “read-only” mode.

**Troubleshooting/Recovery Steps:**

1. Check master node status using cloud console or SSH.
2. Validate if `kube-apiserver`, `kube-scheduler`, and `controller-manager` are running.
3. Check `etcd` health using:

   ```bash
   etcdctl endpoint health
   ```
4. Restart services if needed:

   ```bash
   systemctl restart kubelet
   docker ps  # verify kube-* containers are up
   ```

**How to explain in real-time:**
“In one of our EKS-based clusters, the control plane was temporarily unreachable. Apps were serving traffic, but we couldn’t scale. On investigation, it was a network misconfiguration to the API server, and once fixed, the control plane recovered.”

### ✅ **2. Scenario: Etcd Corruption**

**Question:**
What happens if etcd data gets corrupted or deleted? How do you handle it?

**Answer:**
**Concept:** etcd is the brain of Kubernetes – it stores **cluster state**, nodes, pods, configs, secrets, etc.

**If corrupted:**

* Entire cluster becomes non-functional.
* `kubectl` commands won’t work.
* No new workloads can be scheduled.

**Troubleshooting/Recovery:**

1. Ensure etcd is not running out of disk.
2. Use `etcdctl snapshot restore` if backups are enabled.

   ```bash
   etcdctl snapshot restore /path/to/snapshot.db
   ```
3. Always configure periodic etcd backups:

   ```bash
   etcdctl snapshot save backup.db
   ```

**Real-world explanation:**
“We enabled etcd snapshots every 6 hours via cronjob. One day, due to a disk corruption, etcd crashed. We restored from the latest snapshot and brought the control plane back in under 30 mins.”

### ✅ **3. Scenario: API Server Slowness**

**Question:**
Your team reports `kubectl` is taking a long time to respond. What could be the reason?

**Answer:**
**Possible Reasons:**

* API Server under high load (too many requests).
* etcd is slow or unresponsive.
* Authentication/authorization delays.
* DNS issues in cluster.

**How to troubleshoot:**

1. Check API server logs:

   ```bash
   journalctl -u kube-apiserver
   ```
2. Check metrics if Prometheus/Grafana are set up.
3. Check etcd health & latency.
4. Look at number of open connections using:

   ```bash
   netstat -an | grep 6443 | wc -l
   ```

**How to explain:**
“We observed high latency from `kubectl get pods`. Found that a CI job was flooding the API server with thousands of requests per second. We added rate limiting using `--max-requests-inflight` flag in kube-apiserver.”

### ✅ **4. Scenario: Node Not Joining Cluster**

**Question:**
You added a new worker node, but it's not joining the cluster. How do you debug?

**Answer:**
**Possible Issues:**

* Wrong `kubeadm join` token or expired.
* Network/DNS issues.
* Firewall blocking ports (6443, 10250).
* Kubelet not running.

**Steps:**

1. Check `kubeadm join` command validity.
2. Check `/var/log/syslog` or `journalctl -xe` on the node.
3. Ensure kubelet is running:

   ```bash
   systemctl status kubelet
   ```
4. Check cluster logs on master:

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

**Project explanation:**
“When we auto-scaled the cluster, some nodes failed to join. Logs showed that the bootstrap token had expired. We regenerated the token and added the node successfully.”

### ✅ **5. Scenario: Scheduler Doesn’t Schedule Pods**

**Question:**
Your pods are stuck in `Pending` state. How do you find out if the scheduler is the issue?

**Answer:**
**Possible Causes:**

* Not enough CPU/RAM on any node.
* Taints/Tolerations mismatch.
* NodeSelector/Affinity misconfiguration.
* Scheduler not running.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. Check pod details:

   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   ```
2. Validate node availability:

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes -o wide
   ```
3. Check kube-scheduler logs:

   ```bash
   journalctl -u kube-scheduler
   ```

**Real-time explanation:**
“We had pod anti-affinity rules applied which prevented scheduling due to lack of eligible nodes. Scheduler logs helped identify that issue. We updated the affinity config and pods got scheduled.”
